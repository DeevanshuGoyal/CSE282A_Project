# CSE282A_Project - Diet Optimization for Dysbiotic Microbiome

Diet has been shown to affect the composition of microbiome by changing the number and activity
of different microbial communities by providing or depleting the necessary nutrients. This impor-
tant role suggests that a modified and personalized diet could be utilized to help re-establish a
healthy microbiome from a diseased state. Given the heterogeneity of these communities, and their
differences across individuals and time, this approach presents two main challenges:

* Defining the healthy vs. disease state microbiome profile and; 
* Finding an optimal diet that can most efficiently restore the healthy gut microbiome. 

In this project, we aim to address the second challenge.
